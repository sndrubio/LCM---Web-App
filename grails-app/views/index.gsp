			<h1>Welcome to LCM</h1>
			<h2>Company overview</h2>
			<p>Lambert Condition Monitoring Ltd.’s experience spans over 21 years in the industrial sector of the 
			East Coast of both islands, covering horticultural, agricultural and manufacturing industries such as 
			timber processing companies, cool storage companies, apple packing facilities and meat processing 
			factories. We have found that the technology is invaluable for maintaining production and protecting 
			client’s safety and assets. These programs can greatly minimize repair and labour costs, 
			reduce inventory of parts, and avoid product variation and production loss.</p>
			
			<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
			<p>Lambert Condition Monitoring Ltd.’s goal is to offer the latest world technologies in
			 predictive maintenance to aid industry to reduce production losses and assist in their productivity, 
			 quality, safety and profitability.</p>
			 
			 <h2>Thermography</h2>
			 <p>Thermal imaging has emerged as an effective predictive maintenance technology by identifying 
			 variations that can lead to equipment failure.</p>
			 <p>By using a different spectrum of light, problems that are invisible to the naked eye become clear 
			 with an image of a thermal nature. With regular inspection, issues can be highlighted before damage 
			 occurs, saving production losses and damage to plant and equipment, leaving the machinery operating 
			 in a safe condition.</p>
